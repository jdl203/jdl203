Hello! My name is James Leandri!
I am currently a senior at the Pennsylvania State University and am studying Computer Engineering.
I am the software director for the Penn State Wind Energy Club where we design, build, and compete a Wind Turbine at the annual Collegiate Wind Competition.

I have some of my favorite personal and school projects on my page.
Please check them out!
